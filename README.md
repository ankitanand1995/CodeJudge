# How to set up the project at your local machine?

I guess pip is install at your local machine if not then do:

``` sh
(For Debian based machine)
sudo apt-get install python-pip
```

``` sh

virtualenv <folder-name>
```

Change the directory to folder which you have created
``` sh

Then clone the repositry and move to folder codejudge and follow these steps:
